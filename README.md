# Calorie Calculator

## Overview

Calorie Calculator is a web app that will allow users to keep track of the number of calories they have eaten on a given day. 
Users will be allowed to register their own accounts where they can input their own caloric and 
monetary goals for the day and add foods they have have eaten throughout the day in personal catalog. 
This app will be a useful tool for those who are aiming to cut down on weight, to gain muscle, or to manage their expenses.

Each user will have their own catalog and will have the ability to set caloric and monetary goals for the day. 
Once that's in place, 
as the day goes by, the user can add foods they have eaten to their catalog. The user will be prompted to enter the name
of the food, the time it was consumed, the price, and most importantly, the total calories. As the user continues 
to add new items, the app will notify the user on certain milestones, such as "You have reached half of your goal!" or 
"That just put you over your goal!". The user will be able to moderate their choices via a counter that displays how many 
more calories they have left to reach their goal as well as another one that displays their total amount of money spent.
For each day a user completes, that information will be stored so the user may track their overall progress.
